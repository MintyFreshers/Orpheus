# Orpheus Discord Bot v2 - Complete Rebuild Project Plan

This directory contains a comprehensive project plan for rebuilding the Orpheus Discord music bot from scratch. The plan is designed to help you regain full understanding of the codebase by building it step-by-step in logical phases.

## üìã Project Overview

**Current Challenge**: The existing Orpheus bot has grown complex through AI-assisted development, making it difficult to understand and maintain.

**Solution**: A structured 10-phase rebuild plan that starts simple and progressively adds complexity, ensuring you understand each component before moving to the next.

## üéØ Educational Approach

This plan is specifically designed for learning and understanding:

- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic Discord bot functionality
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each phase builds on previous knowledge
- **Clear Dependencies**: Understand how components interact
- **Hands-on Learning**: Write every line yourself for maximum understanding
- **Best Practices**: Implement clean architecture from the start

## üìÅ Files Included

### `orpheus-v2-project-plan.json`
- Complete project plan in GitHub Projects compatible format
- 10 phases with 47 total tasks
- Organized labels and milestones
- Detailed task descriptions with implementation guidance

### `Import-OrpheusV2Project.ps1`
- PowerShell script to automatically import the plan into GitHub Projects
- Creates labels, milestones, and issues
- Sets up kanban board for project management

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Option 1: Use the Import Script (Recommended)

1. **Prerequisites**:
   ```powershell
   # Install GitHub CLI
   winget install GitHub.cli
   
   # Authenticate with GitHub
   gh auth login
   ```

2. **Create New Repository** (recommended for clean start):
   ```bash
   gh repo create YourUsername/orpheus-v2 --private --description "Orpheus Discord Bot v2 - Clean Rebuild"
   ```

3. **Run Import Script**:
   ```powershell
   .\Import-OrpheusV2Project.ps1 -Owner "YourUsername" -Repository "orpheus-v2"
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. Create a new GitHub repository for your v2 bot
2. Create a new GitHub Project in your repository
3. Manually create labels from the JSON file
4. Create milestones for each phase
5. Create issues for each task
